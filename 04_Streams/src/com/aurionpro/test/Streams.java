//streams --> sequence of bytes attached to i/p our o/p devices
// javaprgam take input from input device through stream this is called inputStream
//javaprgam gives output to output device through stream this is called outputStream


//input stream types --> keyboard, file, database, scanner
//eg -> file -> FileInputStream, FileOutputStream


//stream are of two types
// input stream -> byteStream(read input in terms of bytes) and characterStream
// output stream ->


//if character --. input is (reader) and output(writer)


//if we want to read in terms of bytes from file we have fileinput and file output stream similar for character
//for character --> filereader and filewriter
